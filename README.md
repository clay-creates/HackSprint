# [A Mysterious Beginning]

### Description

A Mysterious Beginning is a game that my partner and I created for our Hack Sprint project. Our protagonist is a grizzled, noir detective, who takes his job too seriously. While hot on the trail of a new lead, he finds himself lost in an unfamiliar place...

We put this demo together in a week, while learning the basics of Godot and GDScript!

If anyone finds this and want to play, you are free to do so!
We hope you enjoy the humble production of our first game! :D
